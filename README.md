# Social-Network-API

## Description

This challenge was to build a API for a social network that allowed users to create user accounts and thoughts, the functionality also was to allow users to add other users as friends, and react to their created thoughts. The API was also meant to allow users to edit their thoughts and delete them if they wanted to. The problems that this would solve would be to give social network applications better functionality to be more interactive for their users. What I learned from building (still building) this API is that their is alot of code and working parts that go into this APis and that time management and breaking down these projects piece by piece is key to successfully pulling it off. While this challenge is still a work in progress I can say I am proud to share what I have completed for it. 

## Installation

To install this project you must first run an npm install. After you will need to run npm start. This will start the server and connect you to the localhost. Since is a server side API you will have to test the routes that are connected to the controllers and models through an open-source desktop application such an Insomnia to check the routes. Since the Api is still under development, we cannot install it to other applications quite yet.

## Usage

This API is used for creating user data, which includes their username, email, thoughts, and friends. It is also suppose to provide the timestamp and date for each thought created and reactions to other users thoughts.
